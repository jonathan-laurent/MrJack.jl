##### Value Function

# Where do we evaluate the value function?
# Easier to compare equal things
# Fixed depth?

# About to select character OR
# How many turns?
# - Never beyond redistribution

# Value: someone is about to play

# Use number of innocented people
# Sherlock cards
# Winning status
# Number of available exits
# Number of lights near exits

# Can escape? provided as a shortcut

# Value from Jack's perspective.
